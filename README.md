# Open Data Commons Spinal Cord Injury Research Explorer 
This website is meant to function as a medical research dashboard and spreadsheet explorer. 
The data on display served as the basis for a 2025 meta-analysis on Spinal Cord Injury research that I'm honored to have contributed to.
To see how I used this data to generate even more figures for the paper, check out my Node.js webscraper repository [here.](https://github.com/sfbarr/Excel-Web-Scraper "sfbarr's repository") 

**More info coming soon...**
